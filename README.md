# Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis

## Overview 
The Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis project is like taking a big, careful look at information about restaurants from Zomato. The goal is to learn a lot about how restaurants work. To do this, we use advanced tools like Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. This project explores things like which types of food are most popular, how many restaurants are in different places, how they decide on prices, and what kind of services they offer in different areas.

## Project goals

This approach enabled the identification of popular cuisines and their regional variations, offering valuable insights into             consumer preferences and market trends.
