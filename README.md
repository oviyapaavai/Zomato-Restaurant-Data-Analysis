# Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis

## Overview 
The Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis project is like taking a big, careful look at information about restaurants from Zomato. The goal is to learn a lot about how restaurants work. To do this, we use advanced tools like Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. This project explores things like which types of food are most popular, how many restaurants are in different places, how they decide on prices, and what kind of services they offer in different areas.

## Project goals
   * Top-Rated Cuisines Analysis: Conducted a detailed analysis to determine the top rated cuisines by analyzing vote count and filtering the data. This method revealed the popular cuisines and their regional variations, offering valuable insights into consumer preferences and market trends.
   * Time-Based Data Structuring: Built  a detailed calendar structure using special DateKey column, which helps us see when new restaurants opened. With this calendar, we can look closely at how the restaurant business has changed over time, focusing on year, quarter, and month.
   * Quantifying Restaurant Presence: Analyzed the number of restaurants across different cities and countries, helping us understand which place have lots of restaurants and which ones have fewer. By doing this, we found out where restaurants are popular and where new restaurants might do well.
   * Service Offering Distribution: Calculated the proportion of restaurants offering table bookings and online delivery services. This helped us see where these services are popular and where they are not used as much.
   * Growth Trends of Restaurant Openings: Employed a hierarchical analysis to categorize restaurant openings by year, quarter, and month. This approach offered insights into the growth trends and seasonal patterns in restaurant openings, highlighting periods of significant expansion or contraction in the industry.
   * Visual Representation of Insights: Developed a series of visualizations, including charts and dashboards, to represent key metrics such as cuisine popularity, restaurant ratings, and service offerings. These visuals were designed to be intuitive and actionable, providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of the data.
   * Price Segmentation Analysis: Created distinct price categories (or buckets) to analyze how restaurants are distributed across different price ranges. This analysis provided valuable insights into the pricing strategies employed by restaurants and how they vary by location. 
   * Cuisine Popularity Exploration: Investigated the popularity of different cuisines at both the country and city levels. Interactive features allowed for the visualization of restaurant details such as names, addresses, average cost for two, and ratings. Filters were applied to identify restaurants with the highest votes for specific cuisines, offering targeted insights into consumer preferences and popular dining options.

## Analytical Tools and Techniques

* **Excel:** Utilized advanced functions including VLOOKUP, PivotTables, and conditional formatting to perform in-depth data analysis and ensure accurate results. These tools facilitated effective data manipulation, aggregation, and presentation. 
* **Power BI:** Created interactive and dynamic dashboards that allowed for comprehensive visualization and analysis of restaurant data. Power BI's features enabled the exploration of trends, patterns, and key metrics through engaging visualizations and interactive elements.
