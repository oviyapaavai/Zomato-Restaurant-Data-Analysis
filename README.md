# Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis

## Overview 
The Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis project is like taking a big, careful look at information about restaurants from Zomato. The goal is to learn a lot about how restaurants work. To do this, we use advanced tools like Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. This project explores things like which types of food are most popular, how many restaurants are in different places, how they decide on prices, and what kind of services they offer in different areas.

## Project goals
   * Top-Rated Cuisines Analysis: Conducted a detailed analysis to determine the top rated cuisines by analyzing vote count and filtering the data. This method revealed the popular cuisines and their regional variations, offering valuable insights into consumer preferences and market trends.
   * Time-Based Data Structuring: Built  a detailed calendar structure using special DateKey column, which helps us see when new restaurants opened. With this calendar, we can look closely at how the restaurant business has changed over time, focusing on year, quarter, and month.
   * Quantifying Restaurant Presence: Analyzed the number of restaurants across different cities and countries, helping us understand which place have lots of restaurants and which ones have fewer. By doing this, we found out where restaurants are popular and where new restaurants might do well.
